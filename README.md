[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/105279206.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/105279206)

### Required Software
This code has been tested in MATLAB 2016b (9.1). Execution requires MATLAB's Statistics, Global Optimization, Optimization, and SimBiology toolboxes.

### A Note About Windows Systems
This code has ONLY been tested in 'nix systems: including Mac OS and RedHat Linux. The codes has never been tested on a Windows system. The authors anticipate problems due to the hard-coding of directory structures. While the fix(s) should be straightforward, the authors are unable to implement it right now.

### Significant Scripts
* **a_make_paper_figs.m** - reads the contents of txtout/ and makes figures similar to the manuscript figures.
* **a_run_vpop_fit.m** - main generation script. Will cycle through methods and iterates to generate data for manuscript.
