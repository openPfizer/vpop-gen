# README #

Source code for Rieger et al. 2017.

### Testing ###
This code has ONLY been tested in *nix systems including Mac OS and RedHat
Linux. It has never been tested on a Windows system. The authors anticipate
potential problems with the hard-coding of directory structures. While the 
fix should be straightforward, the authors are unable to do it at this point.

This code has been tested in Matlab 2016b (9.1). It requires the Statistics, 
Global Optimization, Optimization, and SimBiology toolboxes.

### Significant Scripts ###
a_make_paper_figs - reads the contents of txtout/ and makes figures similar to the manuscript figures.
a_run_vpop_fit - main generation script. Will cycle through methods and iterates to generate data for manuscript.
